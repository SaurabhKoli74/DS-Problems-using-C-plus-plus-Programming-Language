When the Recursive function is at the end of any function it is called 
Tail Recursion but,
--return n*fact(n-1); is not tail recursion it is non_tail recursion
the technique used to convert non_tail recursive to tail recursive is also called TAIL CALL ELIMINATION

Tail call elimination used for avoiding overhead of system becauze then it has to save the previous function status then continue
tail call elimination is possible only in modern computers
in tail call elimination the when the last call is terminated whole program is terminated
